         git & github
         . git is a version control system or tool. simply,a system to manage your files.
         . seves the file locally or remote server(github/gitlab)
         . made by the linux development community 

         . github is a web site/ server which your git is hosted on.
         . your files willbe saved in folder called "repository".

          GIT COMAND                    #FOR FIRST TIME
                                            . cd desktop
                                            . mkdir gtst && cd gtst
                                            . git init
                                        .git config --global user.name<yourusername>
                                        .git config --global user.email
                                        <youremail>
                                        #FOR NORMAL WORKS
                                            . git status
                                            . git add.
                                            . git commit-m'<yourcomment>'#you can check it now
                                            . git log
                                        # FOR GITHUB
                                           . git remote add origin<repositoryURL>
                                           . git push -u origin master
                                           . git clone <your project link>    

git steps method 1 in git
  > step 1:crate note
  > step 2:check the status
  > step 3:commit it
  > step 4:crate repository on github
  > step 5:add the repo link
  > step 6:generate token
  > step 7:push into github

     method 2 in vscode
    method 3 another method
     method 4 in github desktop
       *step 1:create new repository
       *step 2:give it name and location
       *step 3:login to a github account
       *step 4:to take the note
        -open the repositery you created with obsidian or vscode
       *step 5:write your notes
       *step 6:comit
        -when you go back to the github desktop it will automatically detect changes and the new creted files 
        now let's commit
        give it name and if you need description(optional)
        the hit the blue commit button
         then it will show you the name in button left corner.
        *step 7:pushing to github


 WHAT IS HACKING?
    ^ hacking is referred to exploiting system vulnerabilities
       and compromising security control to gian unauthorized
       access to the system
    ^ ethical hacking finds the weak point or loopholes in a computer,
        web application,or network and reports them to the organization  
    ^ the person who do the hacking is called "HACKER".
         
         TYPES OF HACKER BASED ON ETHICS
     BLACK HAT hacker
       > the most evil and bad people
     WHITE HAT hacker
      > the helping and good peoples 
     GRAY HAT hacker
      >the middle mans, good sometimes bad thinking peoples 
          TYPES OF HACKER BASED ON SKILL
       NEWBIE/Noob
        > don't have any knowledge about hacking.
        Script Kiddie
          . A script kiddie,kiddie,or skid is arelatively unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others,primarily for malicious purposes       
        HACKER
          .prefectly skilled,with less experience
        Elite/Pro hackre
          .perfectly skilled,with much more experience 

          WHY DO WE LEARN HACKING??
          1. TO prevent hacker from gaining access
          2. to uncover vulnerabilities
          3. to strengthen the organization
          4. to safeguard the data 
          5. to avid security breaches
          6. to enhance security awareness
          7. to make money

         PHASES OF HACKING
   1. reconnaissance
   2. scanning
   3. gaining access
   4. maintaining access
   5. clearing tracks or log

          PENETRATION TESTING
     * penetration testing is a method of evaluating the security of an information system or networking system or networking by simulatig an attack to
     * find vulnerability
     * security measures 
     * documentation and report preparation  
        WHY WE NEED PENETRATION TESTING?
      > identification of threats 
      > security protections and control 
      > assessment of organization's security
      > evaluation of network security
      > upgradation of infrastructure
            
         TYPES OF PENTESTING
       . black box pentesting
         > testing system without prior knowledge
         > you test as an attacker
       . white box pentesting
         >testing system with prior koowledge
         >you test as as an developer  
       . gray box pentesting
         > testing system with limited knowledge
         > you test as an user
