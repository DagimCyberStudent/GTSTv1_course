           1. Create a telegram support account and chat with them like they got a security breach and ask  them to send the code we sent to you.(worked on 3 peoples) 
           2. Create a telegram bot based on what the user loves then, ask questions like for the registration you need phone number, then be quick and add the number to the telegram and when u are sure the sms is sent for them, ask them to send the registration code we sent then BOOM!(worked on 4 peoples)
